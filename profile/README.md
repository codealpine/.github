## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


CodeAlpine is all about coding and mountains
We are working with some small projects, mostly for fun, and some reserved ones that could turn into a proper workload
Sensitive in nature is our codebase, but if you are interested for more keep in touch
Typescript, JS, Java, PHP and all typed and easy to follow languages are welcomed
